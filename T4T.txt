//ISSUES: 
    CANT RUN IT
    uses handlebars so have to recreate with react 
    figure out what to do with database 



PLAN -
    grab assets of images 
    figure out css usage 
    remember how the pages are made 

    convert all static stuff html and css 


    Find tutorial of react database and utilize that instead of 
    BS MySQL database and Sequelize ORM 





//BRANCHES 
git init 

git branch -b 

1. A-1 

Home page - 

remove navbar, keep logo top left,
have about us btn, register, login, rent a tool, and lend a tool btns 
    about us takes to new page OR instead a smooth transition modal from the right  


install react boostrap 


FIRST STEP FIREBASE (could do MERN but firebase easier)
//Need register and login user so will utilize a backend server to do so.

REACT/TUTORIALS/firebase


A-2 

NOTE: 
    npm run dev 

PLAN: integrate Firebase authentication using tutorial 

1. setup firebase for dev and production 

2. setup connection for dev using:
    firebase.js
    .env.local  
    npm i firebase

3. Signup functionality 
    /contexts/AuthContext.js  - context for all authentication from firebase 
    /components/Signup.js  - components to use (decide if whole page or just child component)

    connect AuthContext to firebase config 
    setup sign up with firebase funcs 

4. Route for signup 
    <App/> signup public route 
    import <AuthProvider/> from AuthContext
    Wrap routes with AuthProvider



A-3 
    PULLING TO DIFF COMPUTER SETUP:

    .env.local for firebase config 
    make sure package.json has all dependencies and package.lock

    style signup page 
    implement auth pages: 
        signup - public DONE 
        login - public
        update profile - private
        forgot password - private

    /components/Login.js
    update AuthContext with login func
    update routes 

TEST OUT WITH TEMP EMAIL 
https://temp-mail.org/en/
//temporary emails 

signup and login 

//add links to register and login for home page 

//Sign up and Login ROUTES SET 

A-4

Logout - btn logs out user redirects to homepage
    Home.jsx -
        event handler, conect to AuthContext

    authcontext.js -
        setup firebase logout func

css- btn display none when log out successful


Logout btn created within Home.jsx 
    check if user logged in 
    if so display logout btn
    when clicked logout btn disappears and user logged out


// NEED TO TURN INTO COMPONENT LATER


A-5 
    forgot password 
        /components/ForgotPassword.js - form to reset password
        <App/> - routes for forgot password
        <AuthContext/> - firebase reset func 

form submit
    sends email to reset password 




A-6

Make private route

<App/> - private route wrapper

X <PrivateRoute/> - protects routes, 
                directs to homepage if not protected route 
                Private routes 


A-7 

Make update-profile page 
update profile - private, need btn, component, and wrapped 

components/updateProfile.js 
authcontext update with methods 
<App/> wrap updateProfile route with privateroute
